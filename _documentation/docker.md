This guide is intended for XMPP Server developers who are building their server using a continuous integration solution that is capable of launching Docker instances.

The Docker-based approach has been created for those development environments that don't match [any of our other, more specific CI-integrations](/index#installation--configuration), but it none-the-less offers the full range of features.

This guide demonstrates how to add XMPP Interoperability and Standards Conformance tests integrated into a build & test pipeline. It is assumed that you already have a pipeline established, and wish to add the additional checks provided by our project.

Docker container images for the XMPP Interop Testing project are published to [the GitHub Package / Container registry of our project](https://github.com/orgs/XMPP-Interop-Testing/packages). Using them can be as simple as this:

{% highlight bash %}
docker pull ghcr.io/xmpp-interop-testing/xmpp_interop_tests:latest

docker run \
    --network=host \
    ghcr.io/xmpp-interop-testing/xmpp_interop_tests:latest \
    --domain=shakespeare.lit \
    --adminAccountUsername=juliet \
    --adminAccountPassword=O_Romeo_Romeo
{% endhighlight %}

The above assumes that your server is running and reachable on the domain `shakespeare.lit` and that it is provisioned with an administrative account (one that is allowed to create other users, per [XEP-0133](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0133.html)) that uses the username `juliet` and the provided password. You'll find the full range of available configuration options below.

## Configuration

Various options are available when invoking the _xmpp_interop_tests_, and whilst none of them are absolutely required, the defaults are unlikely to be perfect for everyone.

| Option                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Default value       |

### Exposing XMPP traffic logs

XMPP traffic is logged by the container in its `/logs` directory. To easily access the XMPP traffic logs, use a bind mount from anywhere on the host machine into the container on the `/logs` path.

For example, by adding `-v "$(pwd)"/xmpplogs:/logs`, a directory named `xmpplogs` (relative to the working directory) on the host is used as a mount for the `/logs` directory on the container: 

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker run \
    --network=host \
    -v "$(pwd)"/xmpplogs:/logs \
    ghcr.io/xmpp-interop-testing/xmpp_interop_tests:main \
    --domain=shakespeare.lit \
    --adminAccountUsername=juliet \
    --adminAccountPassword=O_Romeo_Romeo

# Removed a lot of output for brevity.

$ ls ./xmpplogs | wc -l
255
{% endhighlight %}

### Detecting test failures

Verbose test results are logged on standard-out. To programmatically detect test failures - for example to automatically mark a build as failed - the exit code of the 'docker run' execution can be used. Any non-zero exit code indicate that tests have failed:

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker run \
    --network=host \
    -v "$(pwd)"/xmpplogs:/logs \
    ghcr.io/xmpp-interop-testing/xmpp_interop_tests:main \
    --domain=shakespeare.lit \
    --adminAccountUsername=juliet \
    --adminAccountPassword=O_Romeo_Romeo

# Removed a lot of output for brevity, but test failures were reported.

$ echo $?
2
{% endhighlight %}
