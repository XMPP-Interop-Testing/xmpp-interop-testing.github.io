Since the last update, we've added a lot more options on how to run your tests. We've added a slew of new CI systems, this time focussing on freedom-respecting, open source CI systems for your open source projects.

Recent additions include Jenkins, Drone, Harness and Woodpecker.

This brings our total number of CI systems in which you can run XMPP interop tests up to a whopping *ELEVEN*, plus anywhere else you can run containers!

Whether you're building in GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, Jenkins, Forgejo, Woodpecker, Drone, Hardness or Bamboo, we've got you covered. If you build locally, you can run the JAR, and if you build anywhere that has a Docker or OCI image container runtime, you're sorted.

We've done our absolute best to preserve every option in every runner, but not all CI systems are created equal, and there might be some discrepancies. If there's a feature you're missing that you need, do let us know.

Similarly, If there's a CI system that you're using that you'd like us to support, or if we do support it but you're struggling, come find us [in our MUC](xmpp:interop@conference.igniterealtime.org?join), or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/XMPP-Interop-Testing/smack-sint-server-extensions).

Test all the things!!!1!
