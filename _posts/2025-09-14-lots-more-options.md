Since the last update, we've added a lot more options on how to run your tests.

Recent additions include Jenkins, Drone, Harness and Woodpecker.

This brings our total number of CI systems in which you can run XMPP interop tests up to a whopping *ELEVEN*, plus anywhere else you can run containers!

Whether you're building in GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, Jenkins, Forgejo, Woodpecker, Drone, Hardness or Bamboo, we've got you covered. If you build locally, you can run the JAR, and if you build anywhere that has a Docker or OCI image container runtime, you're sorted.

Test all the things!!!1!

If there's a CI system that you're using that you'd like us to support, or if we do support it but you're struggling, come find us [in our MUC](xmpp:interop@conference.igniterealtime.org?join), or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/XMPP-Interop-Testing/smack-sint-server-extensions).
